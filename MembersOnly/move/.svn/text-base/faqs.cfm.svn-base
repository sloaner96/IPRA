      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building IPRA's Future - Member FAQ's </h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em><strong><br>
        <br>
        Q: Why has this decision been made? </strong></em><br>
        <br>
        <strong>A</strong>: IPRA's Carol Stream facility has become increasingly underutilized while costs to maintain the facility skyrocket. Over time, IPRA memers have requested that committee and section meetings and educational sessions be brought to diverse geographic locations and/or accommodated via telephone or the Internet.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: Can't IPRA rent the building?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: As a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, IPRA is precluded for renting meeting space to non-tax-exempt organizations, eliminating a potential source of revenue.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: What are some specific examples of the costs to maintain the facility?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: With eight HVAC units, five separate roofing structures and 8,000 to 9,000 square feet of underutilized space, the Carol Stream facility now poses a burden on IPRA finances that, projected over five years, threatens to place the association in an untenable fiscal crisis. Necessary roofing replacements alone account for nearly $70,000 required to be spent in the next 48 months. </p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: Are there other factors that led to the timing of the decision?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: Financial pressure on IPRA members' agencies has diminished available funds for continuing education, a vital component of IPRA's non-dues revenue funding.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: Have costs been cut in other ways already?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: In the past 12 months, two full-time staff positions have been replaced by part-time positions and one part-time position has been eliminated. Barring other action, this trend would continue, as would an associated reduction in member service provision.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: Is this move typical for associations?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: Assocations such as IPRA are in the business of providing member services. Dollars spent maintaining the Carol Stream facility reduce the investment that IPRA can make to expand member services.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: What about the Partners for the Future fundraising campaign?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: The Partners for the Future campaign - the fundraising initiative that was launched to pay for the Carol Stream facility - fell short of its goal by nearly $250,000. The Carol Stream facility has served IRPA well as an investment, generating equity that would be eliminated through the necessary maintenance of this asset.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: What will happen to the donations?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: Many Board members and staff are contributors to the Partners for the Future initiative, and as such, are sensitive to the notion that contributions raised through this campaign should be respected as long-term, capital development funds to which donors pledged. </p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: What will be the impact on IPRA's members? </strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: IPRA's Board, in making this decision, considered that the resources required fo the maintenance of the existing headquarters facility would be better utilized through the expansion of member services. The future of your professional association will be brighter, and its capacity to serve its members enhanced through this proactive decision.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Q: How will we be kept informed about the progress being made?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: Updates will be provided to IPRA members on a timely basis in the coming months as we work to provide exceptional service to the park and recreation professionals of Illinois.<br>
        <br>
      <em><strong>Q: Has IPRA decided on a new location?</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>A</strong>: The Relocation Task Force met via conference call to discuss to look at the relocation options. The Task Force has recommended pursuing leased property in Oak Brook, Illinois. After review of lease and purchase pros and cons, considering location convenience for members and staff this site provides the best location and financial considerations for the association. <br>
        <br>
      <em><strong>Q: It appears that personnel expenses were reduced in regards to salary and position, but what about other perks that could be reduced? For instance, a mileage allowance might be more reasonable than purchasing a car for the Executive and Deputy Directors? </strong></em></p>
      <p><strong> A</strong>: The CEO and Deputy Chief Administrator vehicles are leased by the association. The total cost per month for the two leased vehicles is $501.00. &nbsp;IPRA stopped purchasing vehicles after 2002 realizing the capital costs were not in the best interest of the association.&nbsp;In conducting a cost-analysis based on the amount of state-wide driving done by the association staff, it was determined that the association saves over $10,000 per year on leasing vehicles and providing fuel than providing mileage allowance. It was estimated in one month, the CEO mileage costs if utilizing a mileage scenario would be over $800. </p>
