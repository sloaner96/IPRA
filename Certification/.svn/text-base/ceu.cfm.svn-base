                        <p>CEU stands for Continuing Education
                        Unit. One Continuing Education Unit is
                        defined as ten contact hours of
                        participation in an organized continuing
                        education experience under responsible
                        sponsorship, capable direction, and
                        qualified instruction. CPRPs, PPRPs, and
                        APRPs are all required to earn 2.0 CEUs (20 hours) of continuing education during each
                        two-year certification period.</p>
						
                        <p><font color="##FF0000"><strong>WARNING</strong></font>:
                        Don't confuse continuing education units
                        with continuing education credits (CEC), or contact hours. A CEC is a
                        different form of measurement and is
                        accepted by other certification boards. Contact hours may not have
                        met CEU standards. These alternate
                        forms of continuing education <u><strong>may</strong></u> be
                        approved for CEUs by request of the IPRCB. Download an <a href="/forms/ceu_app_indiv.pdf"><b>Application
                          for CEUs</b></a>. There is a nominal $5 fee for this 
                          service.</p>
						  
                          <p>Applications for CEU approval must be received 
                          within 30 days of the completion of the workshop.</p>
