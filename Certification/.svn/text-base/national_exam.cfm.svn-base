							<li>150 test questions, including 125 upon 
	                        which your score will be based, and 25 randomly inserted 
	                        questions that will not be scored but are being 
	                        validated for possible exam use.</li>
							
							<li>Categories include management (41 
	                        questions), programming (49 questions), and operations

                        70%, or within a few points of 85, and test results are 
                        provided to you on-site. You will receive a separate
