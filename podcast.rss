 <title>Attack Update</title>
 <link>http://www.downes.ca</link>
 <description>
 OK, here's where we stand. I have no email into
or out of downes.ca - this means that if you are sending me
email to stephen@downes.ca it will fail. It also means that
newsletter mailouts are failing (at least, I think they're
failing...). Additionally, all scheduled processes have
terminated, which means that Edu_RSS will be updated
manually. I have no tech support until at least tomorrow,
so it looks like we'll be limping along like this for a
bit. Again, please note, email sent to me at downes.ca is
not reaching me. By Stephen Downes, Stephen's Web, July

 <title>Attack on Downes.ca</title>
 <link>http://www.downes.ca</link>
 <description>
 Downes.ca was off the air for a few days
following a denial of service attack. We are back for now
but things are still touch and go. I'll keep you posted.
