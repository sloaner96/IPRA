				  <h4>Labor agency plays hardball with 12-, 13-year-old umps</h4>

                  By Ted Gregory<br>
                  Tribune staff reporter<br>
                  Published April 18, 2002</font><br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Twelve-year-old Brian Glennon planned to spend his summer
                  calling balls and strikes for 8-year-old batters, earning $10
                  a game from the Darien Youth Club baseball league. But thanks
                  to an anonymous complaint, Brian and 35 other young umpires
                  have been fired before the first pitch.<br>
                  <br>
                  Citing child-labor laws, the Illinois Department of Labor told
                  the league in March to stop paying umpires who are not yet 14.<br>
                  <br>
    
                  &quot;It kind of stinks,&quot; said Brian, who completed
                  umpiring classes during the winter to qualify for the job,
                  &quot;because there's absolutely no point to it if you're not
                  going to get paid.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Parents and at least one state lawmaker agree, and a campaign
                  is under way to change the law, which, with few exceptions,
                  restricts anyone under 14 from working for pay.<br>
                  <br>
                  Busting underage summer employment programs has become
                  something of a rite of spring at the state and federal
                  departments of labor. Two years ago, the Kenilworth Park
                  District ended a three-decade tradition of hiring junior high
                  counselors after the state agency notified the district it was
                  violating state law.<br>
                  <br>
                  In 1996, Northbrook Park District was fined $6,075 by the U.S.
                  Department of Labor for employing underage kids to wash golf
                  balls and work in a concession area. A year earlier, Mt.
                  Prospect Park District paid $15,950 for similar child-labor
                  violations.<br>
                  <br>
                  About the same time, Dundee Township, Wilmette Park District,
                  Lincolnwood Parks and Recreation Department and Wheeling Park
                  District also paid fines totaling nearly $30,000 for state and
                  federal violations.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Darien league, which has been hiring umpires like Brian
                  for most of its 42 years, pays the boys $10 per game, usually
                  for a maximum of 10 games and only in the more relaxed
                  atmosphere of the 8-year-old division.<br>
                  <br>
                  After receiving an anonymous complaint, the Illinois
                  Department of Labor audited the league in February; in March,
                  it notified league officials of 180 violations. Besides using
                  underage umpires, the club was cited for violations including
                  failure to keep a registry of minor employees and their
                  schedules and for not keeping employment certificates.<br>
                  <br>
                  The league could theoretically be fined $900,000, more than
                  seven times its yearly budget.<br>
                  <br>
                  Irate parents are collecting signatures to petition for a
                  change in state law. They have enlisted the support of several
                  lawmakers, including state Sen. Kirk Dillard (R-Westmont), a
                  former Little League umpire, who called the situation
                  ridiculous. Dillard has sent letters to the Labor Department
                  and the Illinois Park District Association, asking them to
                  make changing the law a priority.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I find it unbelievable, with all the problems the State
                  of Illinois has,&quot; Dillard said, &quot;that the Illinois
                  Department of Labor picks on children who are umpiring games
                  and in essence, discourages something as wholesome as youth
                  baseball.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Brian's mother, Catherine, is confident she will be able to
                  persuade her son to volunteer to umpire, which is what the
                  Darien organization is asking the youngsters to do. But, she's
                  more than a little peeved.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Catherine Glennon said.
                  &quot;I don't look at it as a child-labor violation. The kids
                  want to do it. It's interesting and fun. They want to make the
                  money, and there aren't a lot of opportunities for these kids
                  to do that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Suzanne Davis, manager of the fair labor standards division at
                  the state agency, was quick to note that it is highly unlikely
                  anything approaching the maximum $900,000 fine will be imposed
                  at an agency hearing June 13.<br>
                  <br>
                  She acknowledged that going after private, non-profit youth
                  leagues, many of which use paid, underage umpires and
                  referees, is unusual. Veterans in the department recall
                  &quot;two or so&quot; that were cited in the last decade for
                  using underage umpires, she said.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We are a complaint-driven agency,&quot; said Davis, who
                  is overseeing the Darien Youth Club case. &quot;When we get a
                  complaint, we respond. I think we responded quite well.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Despite her unpopular position, Davis also says her agency may
                  be protecting the parents and children. &quot;They need to be
                  enjoying their summers,&quot; she said of the children, noting
                  recent cases in which overzealous parents have become violent
                  at youth sports events.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;This can be very physically and psychologically
                  dangerous for these kids,&quot; Davis said. &quot;It's
                  something that everyone understands.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  But league officials said no parent has ever harassed a 12- or
                  13-year-old umpire.<br>
                  <br>
                  Darien Youth Club President Ray Jablonski hopes many of the
                  kids will work as volunteers when the season starts April 27.
                  He will fill the gaps with older umpires and parents.<br>
                  <br>
                  Meanwhile, enterprising parents are plotting, talking about
                  tipping the volunteer umpires, or passing the baseball cap at
                  games.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I feel bad for the kids because the little bit of
                  spending money they earn is being taken away from them,&quot;
                  Jablonski said.<br>
