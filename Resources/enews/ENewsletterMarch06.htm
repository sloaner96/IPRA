            <span class="style71"><strong>Performance Measurement Question</strong> <br>
            <em>Would anyone know what their labor costs are to mow parks per acre? In addition, if anyone would know the total cost, i.e. fuel, depreciation, etc. that would be helpful also. Thanks.</em></span><em><br>
            </em><strong>Store Front Facilities</strong> <br>
            <em>We are wondering if any agency uses store front facilities for their programs. Please let us know as we are looking into this possibility. Thanks!</em> <br>
            <span class="style71"><strong>How to deal with developers</strong> <br>
            <em>I've been asked to sit in on a community subdivision ordinance review with one of the goals being to require developers to participate in parks &amp; open space construction. Has anyone been down this road? I could really use some guidance/ideas on how to deal not only with the developers, but zoning staff that may not have the desire to disagree with the developers or Planning/Zoning boards. Thanks and have a great day!</em> </span><br>
            <strong>In Need of Computer Instructor</strong>
            <br>
            <em>Does anyone have a contact of anyone who would be interested in teaching computer classes in the south suburbs one day per week? We are very flexible around the day of the week. If you are using the instructor, we will not schedule classes on your same day. Also, the instructor will not need any of his/her own equipment. We have our own computer lab. I would appreciate any responses. Thank you!</em> </p>
