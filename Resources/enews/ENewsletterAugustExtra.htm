          <p align="center" class="style44">Cooperative Purchase Program Begins Monday, 8/15 </p>
          <p class="style22"><img align="right" src="http://www.ilipra.org/images/Cooplogo.gif" width="190" height="236">The Illinois Park &amp; Recreation Association would like to invite you and your agency to participate in the NEW &amp; IMPROVED 2005-06 IPRA Cooperative Purchase Program.<br>
            <br>
            Each year, IPRA coordinates a Cooperative Purchase Program specifically for park districts, municipal recreation agencies, forest preserves, conservation districts, special recreation associations and private agencies throughout Illinois. The program is an excellent way for your agency to save staff time and valuable tax dollars by purchasing in bulk with other agencies throughout the state.<br>
            <br>
            The cost savings are an obvious benefit of the program, but there are others:
          <ul>          
			<li>Save time comparing quotes and products.
            <li>Freight and delivery charges are included in vendor&rsquo;s bids.
            <li>Vendors abide by the &ldquo;Local Government Prompt Payment Act&rdquo; allowing agencies 30 days from receipt of invoice to have it approved and another 30 days to make payments.
          </ul>
			<p align="left"><br>
            Participate, register, purchase and track orders all from the comfort of your own computer! The whole process will be easier and faster. No more maintaining a huge database of products and orders by pen and paper. IPRA has simplified the process and taken the hassle out of saving you money.</p>
			<p align="center"> Go online to <a href="http://www.ilipra.org" target="_blank">www.ILipra.org</a>, beginning August 15, to get started. </p>
			<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>
			<ul>
            <li>Designate a member of your staff to serve as primary contact for the Co-op program. This person
            MUST be an IPRA member.
            <li>Primary contact will go to www.ilipra.org and log into the Members Only portion of IPRA&rsquo;s website
            using their username and password. If you do not have this information, please contact Dean
            Comber at dean@ilipra.org immediately.
            <li>Once logged in, Click the image on the right-hand side of the screen labeled &ldquo;IPRA Cooperative
            Purchase Program &ndash; Sign up Today&rdquo;
            <li>Verify information and assign Secondary Contact (if applicable). Secondary contact is an additional
            person at your park and recreation agency that will have access to manage your co-op account
            online. This person DOES NOT have to be an IPRA member and will receive their login/password
            credential via the email address provided.
            <li>Confirm Memorandum of Understanding and complete Payment Information screens.
            <li>Click on Cooperative Purchase Program link to begin ordering. PLEASE NOTE: There will be no
            changes to agency orders after Sept. 16 &ndash; you may make changes to your orders as many times as
            you like until this date. Verify your orders. IPRA will not be responsible for any inaccurate data that is
            in the system and will not make any changes after September 16, 2005.
			<li>If you experience any problems while completing the registration/ordering process, please contact
			IPRA immediately at coopsupport@ilipra.org with a detailed message. IPRA will do its best to
			respond to your inquiry as soon as possible. PLEASE NOTE: IPRA computer systems (phone and
			e-mail) will be shut down effectively at 5:00 PM on Wednesday, August 31, 2005 and will resume
