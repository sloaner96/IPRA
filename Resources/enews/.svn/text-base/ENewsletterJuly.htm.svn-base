            <span class="style41">The Blog Spot Makes History and Sparks Interaction</span>            <br>
            <span class="style33">The Illinois Park and Recreation Association makes history with its recent introduction of The Blog Spot. The 2,700 plus member base of park and recreation professionals, along with the general public, now has the ability to interact, learn and have fun in IPRA&rsquo;s newly created blog. The Blog Spot, <A 
href="http://IPRA.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://IPRA.blogspot.com</A>, features up to the minute news, chat rooms, pictures and polls relevant to the park and recreation professional.<BR>
            <BR>
            The creation and implementation of The Blog Spot comes from member feedback received through an online survey conducted of the January 2005 redesign of the IPRA website. Professional members of the association stated that increased technological advancements to further communication and learning would be of great benefit.<BR>
            <BR>
&ldquo;Creating The Blog Spot increases the number of ways IPRA can communicate directly with our members,&rdquo; said Matt White, Communication and Marketing Manager for IPRA. &quot;We are firm believers in technology and we wanted to provide something fresh and unique to the park and recreation field. No one out there is doing what we are doing.&rdquo; <BR>
<BR>
Blogs have been in existence for several years now but have primarily been an &ldquo;underground&rdquo; medium. Just recently are you finding mainstream media outlets using blogs to interact with their consumers. Blogs have gained widespread acceptance in the business world due to their ability to connect with the end-user in a way that sparks conversation and leads to further brand awareness.<BR>
<BR>
IPRA has embraced technology with open arms with the redesign of their website, the implementation of monthly eNewsletters, a staff-utilized Intranet and now the interactive blog. On the horizon IPRA will soon be launching an online cooperative purchase program for its members to buy bulk supplies and equipment at significant savings.<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;We are continually expanding our resources and using technology to advance the professional careers of our members,&rdquo; said Dean Comber, IT Manager for IPRA. &ldquo;We have some of the brightest park and recreation professionals here in Illinois so we must keep up with the times and be able to provide them with the resources needed to succeed and grow.&rdquo; <BR>
<BR>
The Blog Spot launched on the IPRA website Monday, June 6 with immediate positive feedback. Some of the topics  in discussion include obesity in children, trends in alternative recreation activities, interesting facts about the benefits of recreation to individuals and the community and highlights from local park district events. <BR>
<BR>
An interactive chat room on the blog allows users to post questions they may have and receive feedback in a format similar to that of Instant Messenger. <BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;I am so proud of the hard work that went in to making The Blog Spot happen,&rdquo; said Bill Wald, Chief Executive Officer of IPRA. &ldquo;The feedback we have received from the field and our board of directors has been great.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
&ldquo;The new blog is yet another reason why our members are so grateful to have an association like IPRA,&rdquo; said Jim Reuter, IPRA Chairman of the Board and Director of the South Elgin Recreation Department. &ldquo;My staff and I really enjoy reading the topics being discussed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every day you can Interact, Learn and Have Fun in The Blog Spot. <a href="http://IPRA.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Check it out now</a>. </span> </p>

<div align="left"><span class="style41">Players' Kids are Playing at the Wee Western</span><br>
              <span class="style33">While their dads are out on the golf course competing for the Cialis Western Open championship, kids of all ages are busy having fun at the Wee Western. The children of professional golfers around the world travel to Lemont each year. But there will be no golfing for those kids. No watching golf. The kids are here to have fun, laugh, take day trips to Chicago-area amusement parks and play with the volunteers from the Illinois Park &amp; Recreation Association.</span>
          </div>
          <p align="left" class="style33"> The PGA day care center, known the week of June 27 though July 3 as the Wee Western, is a floating facility that moves from tournament to tournament. Upwards of 80 kids will again be reunited together during the week-long golf tournament to hang out, play and take day trips with local volunteers from the Illinois Park &amp; Recreation Association. The Carol Stream association handles the logistics and the volunteers each day of the tournament.</p>
          <p align="left"> <span class="style33">&ldquo;Partnering with the Profession Golf Association to provide daycare options and a fun place for the players&rsquo; kids to hang out has always been a rewarding experience for us volunteers,&rdquo; said Mike Selep, IPRA Professional Services Director. &ldquo;We provide a home away from home for the kids and by taking day trips to area amusement parks we really get to show off our great city.&rdquo;</span></p>
          <p align="left" class="style33"> The preparation needed to coordinate such an important event like the Wee Western begins weeks prior to the PGA&rsquo;s arrival to Lemont. In order to provide a top-notch day care facility for the kids of professional golfers there is a lot of time spent organizing and shopping that needs to get done.</p>
          <p align="left"> <span class="style33">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working tirelessly to make sure this year&rsquo;s Wee Western is as successful as in years past,&rdquo; said Heather Weishaar, IPRA Corporate Relations Manager and Wee Western Coordinator. &rdquo;Between all the food, beverages and decorations we set up and provide for the Wee Western as well as coordinating exciting games and day trips we know the kids are going to have a great time.&rdquo;</span></p>
          <p align="left" class="style33"> The Professional Golf Association mandates that the location of the Wee Western facility and the planned day trips remain confidential due to tight security measures.</p>
          <p align="left" class="style33"> For more information about the Wee Western and the volunteer efforts provided by the members of the Illinois Park &amp; Recreation Association please call Mike Selep, Professional Services Director for IPRA at (630) 752-0141.</p>

              <span class="style33">For her entire professional career, going on her 24th year, Amy Charlesworth has served the Rolling Meadows Park District. Her dedication and love for the field is evident and the members of IPRA will have the honor and privileged of seeing Amy serve a three-year term as the  Chairman of the IPRA Board of Directors beginning in 2007. </span>
            </div>
    <p align="left"><span class="style41">Q&amp;A with Amy Charlesworth</span><br>
              <span class="style45">Q: </span><span class="style33">Why do you aspire to be Chairman of the IPRA Board of Directors? <br>
              </span><span class="style45">A:</span><span class="style33"> I have been an active participant of my professional association for over 20 years; I believe serving as Chairman is a culmination of years of volunteer service to my professional association. It would be an honor to represent my peers as a leader for the association.<br>
              </span><strong><br>
            <span class="style45">Q: </span><span class="style33">Describe your leadership style?</span> </strong><span class="style33"><br>
            <span class="style47">A:</span>            In general I lead in a participative way. It is usually my aim to create a cohesive atmosphere that encourages people to work together for a common goal. <br>
            </span><strong><br>
            <span class="style45">Q: </span><span class="style33">If elected Chairman, what is the one thing you would like to champion during your three years in office?</span> </strong><span class="style33"><br>
            <span class="style47">A:</span>            We are coming off a real transition period for our association, we&rsquo;ve changed our fiscal year, we&rsquo;ve had many staff changes, and we&rsquo;ve sold a building. All of these activities have contributed to a change in our operations. The financial forecast that indicated the need to sell the building now needs to be revisited and a new <em>strategic financial plan</em> needs to be developed, instead of concentrating a budget on how to fund capital improvements we can focus on how we are benefiting our best assets &ndash; our membership. <br>
            </span><strong><br>
            <span class="style45">Q: </span><span class="style33">What do you feel should be IPRA staff&rsquo;s priorities during the next three years?</span><br>
            </strong><span class="style33"><span class="style47">A: </span>Our priority should always be <em>service to our membership.</em> Each staff member is responsible for a different component of what we offer our members. We have had an enormous amount of staff change in the past two years. I have experienced this as a part of my work environment over my years at Rolling Meadows. I have a phrase that I have used with new staff at work. It takes one year to learn the job, the next year to feel comfortable and start to implement change and the third year to really make it your own. Looking at the current staff team I see a positive energy as well as a strong desire to be successful. As we continue to shift from a volunteer driven association to a staff driven association we need to trust the staff to use their abilities to guide our volunteers as new opportunities are presented to the membership.</span></p>

        <span class="style33">Last week we came across an interesting <a href="http://partnershipforschools.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>  highlighting notes from the school district's board meetings and general district news. This is a perfect example of how your agency came easily, cost-effectively and routinely update the residents of your community. If your agency is having a difficult time communicating and getting feedback from your residents maybe it's time you created a blog. <br>
