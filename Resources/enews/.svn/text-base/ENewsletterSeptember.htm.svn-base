      <p class="style22"><span class="style41">Solving the Wastepaper Problem</span><br>
        <span class="style33">Genetic engineering is normally associated with creating things, but now researchers are hoping it will destroy.</span></p>
      <p class="style33">The global wastepaper glut--caused by insufficient moisture in the world&rsquo;s landfills to break the paper down--could be solved with a genetically modified form of cellulosome under development at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science. Cellulosome is a molecular complex that degrades cellulose, a major component of wood and other plants.</p>
      <p class="style33">In the laboratory, the modified cellulosome took only a day to turn finely chopped paper into a syrup of soluble sugars. Although the designer molecules are not yet ready to be applied to actual landfills, the process offers hope for a solution to a growing problem.</p>
      <p class="style33">A simple way that you and your agency can help reduce the wastepaper problem is to use recycled paper. Now that you are using recycled paper...recycle it by placing them into the recycling bins provided by your waste management company. </p>
