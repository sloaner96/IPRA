          <span class="style41">Sale Of IPRA Building Complete </span>            <br>
          <span class="style33">After receiving disappointing news last month regarding the sale cancellation of the IPRA building...we have now agreed to terms with the original buyers and the DEAL IS DONE! IPRA will close on the sale of their headquarters at 106 N. Schmale Rd. in Carol Stream the first week in August. IPRA will then lease the property back from the buyers until September 1 when the new office space will be ready for move-in. <br>
          <br>
          The centrally-located, modern and space-efficient office is located at 1815 S. Meyers Rd., Suite 400 in Oakbrook Terrace.<br>
          <br>
          Please understand, there will be a period of time from September 1-6 that the staff at IPRA will be unreachable by phone, fax and email. An office move of this magnitude will take a great deal of preparation prior to the move, and a great deal of time to get back up and running as normal. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br>

        <SPAN class=style33>The Wage and Hour division of the Department of Labor (&ldquo;DOL&rdquo;) has posted an interpretation of the FLSA. The &ldquo;Fact Sheet&rdquo; states that 15 year olds can only be employed as a lifeguard at a &ldquo;traditional swimming pool&rdquo; and cannot be employed as a lifeguard at those parts of a facility which constitute elevated slides, artificial waves or other amusement type &ldquo;rides&rdquo; or mechanical devices. This is something to think about next season when hiring for your pool.<br>

        Congratulations to Oralethea Davenport, CPRP of the Lan-Oak Park District for her continued successes including her most recent accomplishment. She has been named by NRPA as a Young Professional Fellowship recipient!<br>
        <br>
        The Fellowship provides selected young professionals (up to 8) with the opportunity to explore the operation of NRPA and its governing bodies at the 2005 NRPA Congress in San Antonio, Texas.&nbsp; Participants will meet with NRPA leadership and staff to review Congress plans, and will attend various Congress sessions, Trustee and Branch meetings with their assigned mentor.&nbsp; A primary&nbsp;focus of the program is to inspire future participation and leadership in the National Recreation &amp; Park Association, and to develop professional contacts with NRPA officers, trustees, and other professionals from around the nation.&nbsp; Fellowship participants will also become involved in networking with members in their region following Congress.  NRPA will provide a complimentary registration to the Congress and NRPA special events.&nbsp;<br>

        <span class="style44"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The decision by the Buffalo Grove Park District to ban smoking at all outdoor facilities has created a back-lash from pro-smoking groups.
