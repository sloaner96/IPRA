According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 205,000 children are treated for playground accidents annually, with approximately 15 resulting in death. Of these, 70% occurred at public parks and schoolyards. Does your equipment measure up? How many preventable injuries occurred in your parks? <br>
<br>
Sponsored by the Illinois Park and Recreation Association (IPRA) and the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA), this course is the most comprehensive training program offered on playground hazard identification and risk management methods. Advanced reading and ten hours of training will prepare you to take the Certified Playground Safety Inspector (CPSI) Exam, which will take place on the last day. <br>
<br>
The National Playground Safety Institute (NPSI) promotes children&rsquo;s rights to play and the importance of play in a child&rsquo;s development. The course provides the most current comprehensive training program on public playground safety, including the development and distribution of playground training and safety products. NPSI provides input to help develop a responsible public policy which guarantees the safety of our children. At the same time, NPSI advocates sound fiscal responsibility to provide resources for the ongoing maintenance and support of the policy.

        </span></span> <span class="style33">
        </span></o:p><span class="style33">Each year, IPRA coordinates a Cooperative Purchase Program on behalf of park districts, municipal recreation agencies, forest preserves, conservation districts, special recreation associations and private agencies throughout Illinois. The program, the only one of its kind in the field of parks and recreation, is an excellent way for your agency to <strong>save staff time</strong> and <strong>valuable tax dollars</strong> by purchasing with other park and recreation agencies in bulk.<br>
        <br>
The savings is an obvious benefit of the program, however, the Co-op program offers other benefits as well. You save time comparing quotes and products. Freight and delivery charges are included in vendor&rsquo;s bids, so there are no surprises when it&rsquo;s time for delivery, and Vendors abide by the &ldquo;Local Government Prompt Payment Act&rdquo; allowing agencies 30 days from receipt of invoice to have it approved and 30 days after approval to have it paid.<br>
<br>
        </span><o:p><span class="style33">Online registration and ordering will begin mid-August...stay tuned for specific dates.

        <br>
        Participants of the Park Pursuit, made up of teams of four, will be challenged both physically and mentally as they race through the streets and parks of Lincoln Park. Clue cards will direct teams to various Lincoln Park landmarks where tasks will be performed to continue on in the race. Not only are bragging rights at stake but participants will get a true sense of unity while learning to work better as a team.<br>
