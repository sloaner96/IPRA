  Give Someone the Recognition They Deserve <br>
            </span><span class="style33"><em>by Joe Pollina, Glenview Park District </em><br>
            As professionals in the parks and recreation field, our success is measured by the quality of our staff, volunteers and sponsoring agencies. &nbsp;Sometimes we take them for granted or send them a &quot;thank you&quot; note but rarely do we truly give them the recognition they deserve.<br>
            <br>
            Through the IPRA Awards and Recognition program you have the opportunity to finally recognize all of those individuals or sponsors who have helped make your area of responsibility a success. &nbsp;By visiting the IPRA website and downloading a simple application form, you can honor anyone who you feel is deserving of the honor. &nbsp;By sending in the application along with a $30 fee per award, you will bestow an award to those deserving as a token of appreciation from your agency and IPRA.<br>
            <br>
The process of recognizing someone for the Community Service Award is quick and simple but the lasting effect this will have to the recipient is endless. <br>
<br>

            Go to the <a href="http://www.ilipra.org/Members/Awards.cfm" target="_blank">Awards &amp; Recognition page</a> online to view all of the award descriptions and to download the necessary forms.
            <br>
            <br>
          All nominations must be delivered to the IPRA office no later than <strong>October 31, 2006</strong>. </span> </p>

        </span></span> <span class="style33">
        </span></o:p><span class="style33">Each year, IPRA coordinates a Cooperative Purchase Program on behalf of park districts, municipal recreation agencies, forest preserves, conservation districts, special recreation associations and private agencies throughout Illinois. The program, the only one of its kind in the field of parks and recreation, is an excellent way for your agency to <strong>save staff time</strong> and <strong>valuable tax dollars</strong> by purchasing with other park and recreation agencies in bulk.<br>
        <br>
The savings is an obvious benefit of the program, however, the Co-op program offers other benefits as well. You save time comparing quotes and products. Freight and delivery charges are included in vendor&rsquo;s bids, so there are no surprises when it&rsquo;s time for delivery, and Vendors abide by the &ldquo;Local Government Prompt Payment Act&rdquo; allowing agencies 30 days from receipt of invoice to have it approved and 30 days after approval to have it paid.<br>
<br>
Listen to Heather Weishaar, IPRA Development &amp; Project Director, talk about the Co-Op Program on IPRA's podcast, <a href="http://www.ilipra.org/podcast/podcast.cfm" target="_blank">WIPRA-The Voice</a>. Learn about the benefits your agency will see by participating. <br>
<br>

        <br>
        Participants of the Park Pursuit, made up of teams of four, will be challenged both physically and mentally as they race through the streets and parks of Lincoln Park. Clue cards will direct teams to various Lincoln Park landmarks where tasks will be performed to continue on in the race. Not only are bragging rights at stake but participants will get a true sense of unity while learning to work better as a team.<br>
