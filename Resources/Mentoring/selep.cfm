					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong> I have been in the field of Parks and Recreation for 13 years, serving in a variety of capacities at several agencies. I have worked for WSSRA as a Program Coordinator, hiring and training part time staff and volunteers and managing Day Camp. I have worked for the Schaumburg Park District as an assistant in the Communications and Corporate Recreation areas, as well as serving as a member of the Business Department in the roles of Information Technology Coordinator, Accountant, and Grant Writer. I currently serve as the supervisor for six highly-motivated Therapeutic Recreation Specialists with FVSRA. I enjoy the profession tremendously because of the diversity involved in every position I have held. I would like to assist others by being a mentor because of the great mentoring that I have received from other professionals in the field. I want others to know that I am willing to share whatever knowledge I have with them and could learn from them in the process. I am an active member of my church, enjoy golfing, playing tennis, watching movies, and reading funny spy novels. Vote for Pedro!
