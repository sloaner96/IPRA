					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong>  I worked in a Day Camp prior to attending college and trying to figure out what I wanted to major in. After taking a career aptitude test and matching most closely with a female PE teacher, which is not to far off from Parks and Recreation, I decided to check on the Recreation field and found my passion. I was actually a Director of that same agency where I started as a Day Camp Counselor, two weeks out of college. I was the only full-time staff and most of the work was maintenance related. It was a learning experience, to say the least, for both the agency and me. Even though I haven't moved grass or groomed a ball diamond, I think the experience gave me an appreciation of that side of the job and instilled in me that you really need to see something first hand to really understand it. I spent most of my time mowing grass, flooding ice rinks and trying to get year round recreational programs off the ground. I spent 8 years at that job in Clarendon Hills and then was hired as the Director of Parks and Recreation for the City of Palos Heights where I still work after 16+ years. It is a municipal recreation department, which delivers essentially the same services as a park district, but it a different taxing body with its own politics and nuances. It is a great town to work in and I am fortunate to have alot of great staff working with me. During my time in Palos Heights, I have also become very involved professionally with IPRA, from the Conference Committee, Professional Development School and as the current Metro-South rep. to the IPRA Board of Directors. It has been a real committment of time, but I have met alot of smart people and friends that have helped make me a more knowledgeable professional and employee. It is great to be able to pick up the phone and call a peer and get help with a problem. My motivation to be a mentor goes back to my internship at the Elmhurst Park District. My immediate boss, Dan Newport, who is now retired, was such a strong influence in my development as as a person and professional, that much of the 4 months experience shaped my current professional philosophy. It is corny, but it is a giveback to the field since a professional took the time to mentor me, but I think it really is a learning experience both ways and I am a strong believer in always bettering yourself through learning. I like to meet new people and share experiences that I might learn from. I have volunteered as a mentor before at Conference and those were very shortlived and not very rewarding. I figured that I should give it another shot. In my off hours, I enjoy being with my wife Annette and sons Jack(6) and Mitchell(1 1/2), golf, current events(especially in our field)fantasy baseball and reading.
