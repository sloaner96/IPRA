</p>
					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong> I have worked for the Park Ridge Park Disrict for 27 years. I started my career as a Recreation Supervisor in charge of a wide variety of programs--pre-school, seniors, art classes, camps, etc. In 1981, I narrowed my focus to seniors and have done that since. In directing the senior center program, I have worked with full time staff, worked with budgets and fundraising, taught classes, planned programs and special events, and worked a great deal with volunteers. I have been involved with IPRA in the Rec Section for many years. I chaired the senior committee and have been the chair of the Six County Senior Olympics since it started in 1981. I would really like to work with new people in the field. Parks and Recreation is such an important part of every community. As a mentor, I want to help and encourage professionals to stay in the field. I wish I had had a mentor to help me through the "rough spots" and just provide a listening ear. Outside of work, I love to figure skate particulary synchonized skating. I have two children and like to volunteer with their school events. I also swim and read.
