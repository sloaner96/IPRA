					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong>  I have been at the Morton Grove Park District for over 4 years. My main responsibility is the supervision of all our athletic programs as well as teen activities. In the past I have also supervised our summer camp programs as well as various youth activities. I have an interest in participating in this mentoring program because when I first started in the field, I too looked to the seasoned professionals for their expertise and advise. I feel that those experiences helped me, and now I would like to do the same for someone else. My background and professional development may just make a difference to a young professional who is just getting started in our field. Interests outside of work include playing sports such as basketball, ultimate frisbee, and frisbee golf. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends and traveling throughout the year.
