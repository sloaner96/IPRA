					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong>  I started my career in parks and recreation as a Jr. Leader at Schaumburg Park District when I was 13 years old, but I would say my first introduction to recreation and leisure pursuits was my first parks class I took with my Dad... Parent & Tot Tumbling! Hmm... he wasn't much into the jumping around on the trampoline or climbing around on the monkey bars. Instead, my Dad and I enjoyed ice cream at the nearby parks on Tuesday nights during our scheduled "tumbling time." I am sure none of the Dad's do that now that are enrolled in the programs I supervise here at the Village of Algonquin! :) Working with the Village of Algonquin has been an exciting adventure that I always enjoy being a part of. Coming from over six years of aquatics experience at the Schaumburg Park District, I brought my knowledge and strengths on board to what is one of the best chapters in my life... Creating a Recreation Agency from the ground up. Everyday is always full of exciting adventures, challenges, and tasks. Being a mentor is important to people pursuing this field to be encouraged to realize the importance and the impact play has on all people from various professionals who are in the field. I spend much of my time volunteering on different projects. Checking out the sights around Chicago. Painting...Swimming...Walking...Rollerblading...Crossword Puzzles...Karaoke...Visiting My Grandparents...Playing Football, Soccer, Tennis, Checkers, Shoots & Ladders, Monopoly, Wheel of Fortune, and this really cool game that I learned at camp when I was in third grade! :) Basically, I will try anything once (it's kinda like brussel sprouts) you have to try it once to find out you don't like it! :) </p>
