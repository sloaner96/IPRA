					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong> Currently, I am employed as a Recreation Supervisor for the Village of Lake in the Hills Parks & Recreation Department. The opportunity to work for the municipality is a unique and rewarding experience. My career experiences are a Resident Camp Director for the Girl Scouts - Sybaquay Council, as a College Recruiter, Assistant Softball and Soccer Coach for Iowa Wesleyan College, as an Assitant Director of the Weber Before and After School Program and a Recreation Supervisor for the City of North Liberty Parks & Recreation Department. Becoming a mentor is not only an opportunity for me to provide learning experiences for a protege, but to be able to learn from them as well. I have a wide variety of interests anywhere from softball to fishing, crocheting and other arts and crafts.
