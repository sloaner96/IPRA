</p>
					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong> I started working for Oak Park in 1990 part-time and quickly became a Community Center Director later that year. I moved to the Golf Maine Park District as their Superintendent of Recreation and held the position from 1996 to 2000. The Manager of Community Centers position opened up in 2000 and I moved back to Oak Park. I have been involved with IPRA state conferences every year and presented in 2003. I have also been involved with the Professional Development School for 10 years and have been on the board of regents for the past 3 years with three more years coming. Dan schimmel mentored me in this group for the past two years. I believe I have enough experiences over the past 14 years to pass on to young professionals and am excited to help give direction where needed. Personally, I have always been very active in most sports including softball, soccer, volleyball and flag football. I'll try just about any and watch most.
