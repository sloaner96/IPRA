					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong> Graduated from George Williams College in 1981. Graduated from Western Illinois University in 1986. Completed my undergraduate internship with the Lemont Township Park District and my graduate internship with the Glenview Park District. First position with Medinah Park District (February 1985 to August 1986) as the Recreation Supervisor. I scheduled all programs (we were very small at the time). My second position took me to the Schaumburg Park District (August 1986 to June 1991) as the Cultural Arts Supervisor. I took care of all the arts programming for the district. My current position is with the Palatine Park District (June 1991 to present). I am the Cultural Arts Coordinator and not only schedule all the arts programming but also manage an historic theater (Cutting Hall) an amphitheater (Fred P. Hall Amphitheater) and an historic museum (Clayson House Museum). I supervise two full time staff and approximately 50 part time staff. My interest lies in the arts.
