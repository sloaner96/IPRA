					  <p><strong>Personal Summary:</strong>  I am currently the Manager of Outreach and Youth Services for the Northeast DuPage Special Recreation Association. I started with NEDSRA in 1991 as an Outdoor Education and Recreation Specialist. In 1993, I moved to Charlotte, NC where I was employed with the Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Department running inner-city youth-at-risk programs. I moved back to Illinois in 1997 and resumed employment with NEDSRA. I was the ITRS “Professional of the Year” in 1999 and have specialized in local programs for youth at risk over the past five years. I have learned a lot over the years through my involvement with IPRA and ITRS, and would like to mentor young professionals as I was mentored by many distinguished professionals.
