                        1981, the Illinois Park and Recreation Association
                        (IPRA) College and University Relation Committee
                        established an educational grant/scholarship program
                        designed to assist individuals in furthering their
                        educational endeavors. In 2003, the Illinois Park and
                        Recreation Foundation began funding the scholarship
                        program. Scholarships up to <b>$2,000.00</b> will be
                        awarded. In addition, all award recipients will receive
                        a one-year IPRA membership.</p>
                        
						<p>Payment
                        of the awards will be made in two installments. The
                        first half of the award will be mailed to the student
                        scholarship recipients in September, with the second
                        half distributed at the IPRA Annual Meeting at the
