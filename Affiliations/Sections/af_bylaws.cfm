                      A board vacancy occurs when a member of the board is
                      unable to complete his term.&nbsp; The A &amp; F Section
                      Board may appoint a replacement to fill the remainder of
                      the term.

                      When a vacancy occurs in the director position, the
                      director-elect assumes the position and an election is
                      held, at the next regularly scheduled election, to select
                      a new director-elect.&nbsp; The new director may choose to
                      serve:&nbsp; a) the remainder of the new term and his
                      previously scheduled term, or b) the current term he has
                      assumed.&nbsp; If the director-elect is not able to assume
                      the role of director, the section board will then appoint
                      a new director by a 2/3rds vote to fill the term.
