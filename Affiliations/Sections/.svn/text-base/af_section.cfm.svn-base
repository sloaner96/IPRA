			                  <p>In terms used by the park and recreation movement, membership 
			                    in the A&F Section of the Illinois Park and Recreation Association 
			                    creates benefits that are endless. These benefits contribute 
			                    to personal growth, the profession as a whole, and last a 
			                    lifetime. </p>
			                  <p>The A&F Section allows members the opportunity to remain 
			                    in touch with other professionals that share their concerns 
			                    about issued that involve park and recreation. These could 
			                    involve young professionals seeking out their desires to become 
			                    informed on the role of an administrator; older professionals 
			                    providing mentorship in which others may learn from their 
			                    expertise; or middle aged professionals zealously confronting 
			                    the current trends of the day. </p>
			                  <p>Other benefits of membership include a scholarship program 
			                    for continuing education opportunities, insight into current 
			                    issues, and the opportunity to meet peers that can create 
			                    lifelong relationships. </p>
			                  <p>Whatever the focus, A&F Section members grow together. All 
			                    administration and finance personnel involved in the field 
			                    of park and recreation share the same ideals of responsibility 
			                    and challenge. This creates a true networking opportunity 
			                    that exists through the A&F Section. So, climb aboard and 
			                    share your knowledge, learn from friends.</p>
