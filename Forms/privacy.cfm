					<li>A link to the privacy policy of the Web site should be provided on the home page or the site navigational bar and should be easily accessible to the user. The Web site should adhere to the privacy principles posted. </li>
					<br><br>
					<li>Individuals responsible for Web sites that post advertising should be aware of current technology and access possessed by third parties that post or link to advertisements. Web sites should ensure that the technology and access used by third parties adheres to the Web site's privacy policies. </li>
					<br><br>
					<li>The site should not collect name, e-mail address, or any other personal information unless voluntarily provided by the visitor after the visitor is informed about the potential use of such information.  The IPRA does not collect any personal information from a site visitor unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally provides it.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>Collection, retention, and use of personal information about site visitors may occur if you choose to interact with the IPRA's website, for example, to enroll for membership or to acquire or participate in one of IPRA's products or services.  Depending on the type of product or service that you request, you may be asked to provide different personal information.  The IPRA may require your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, Internet protocol address, social security number and/or other identifying information.  All credit card data (individual/agency name(s) and numbers) is encrypted both during the transaction process and in IPRA databases. IPRA adheres to all current technological standards regarding your personal banking information. For a listing of the type of personal information collected, please refer to the appropriate online form.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>Personal information about a visitor's access and navigation, and personal information volunteered by site visitors as part of a survey, may be used by the site owner to improve the site but should not be shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes without the site visitor's express permission.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>The IPRA will use e-mail addresses voluntarily provided by site visitors to notify them about opting in to receiving updates, products, services, activities, or upcoming events from the IPRA or affiliated entities. Site visitors who do not wish to receive such e-mails from the IPRA should not opt in.  Site visitors are able to opt out of receiving such information at any time.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>The IPRA may use your personal information collected via the Web site (except for email address information which use is outlined above) for the following purposes:</li>
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Register you in programs. </li>
						<li>Process, fulfill and follow up on orders. </li>
						<li>Answer your e-mails. </li>
						<li>Send information you request. </li>
						<li>Send and process surveys. </li>
						<li>Ensure the IPRA site is relevant to your needs. </li>
						<li>Deliver IPRA services such as newsletters, meetings or events. </li>
						<li>Notify you about new products/services special offers, upgrades and other related information from the IPRA. </li>
						<li>Provide approved third parties an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. </li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					<li>The IPRA also occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration.  We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>The IPRA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the IPRA, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of IPRA, or (c) protect the personal safety of IPRA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>Non-identifiable Web site visitor data may be collected and used in aggregate to help shape and direct the creation and maintenance of content and to determine the type of advertisement to be seen by site visitors while on the IPRA site.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>A cookie is a small file stored on the site user's local hard drive, which is distributed by a Web server and is used to aid Web page navigation. Two types of cookies are commonly used. A session cookie is a temporary file created whenever a Web site is accessed and is self-terminated based either on an expiration date (e.g., 10 seconds to 3 hours from creation of the cookie) or by closing the Web browser. A persistent cookie is a permanent file and must be deleted manually. Cookies referred to in the context of this Privacy Statement are session cookies. A cookie function may be used on the site to track visitor practices to help determine which site features and services are most important and guide editorial direction. The cookie makes it possible for the user to access the site without requiring entry of a user name, which allows the user to view different restricted areas of the site without reregistering and allows the user to personalize the site for future use.  Users who do not desire the functionality created by the cookie should have the option to disable the cookie function, either by indicating when asked that they do not wish to have a cookie created or by disabling the cookie function on their browser. Individuals should be able to opt out of cookie functions that permit tracking of personal information at any time.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>E-mail messages may not be secure. Site visitors should be careful when sending confidential information by e-mail. Site visitors sending e-mail accept the risk that a third party may intercept e-mail messages. </li>
					<br><br>
					<li>If you are a registered user of the IPRA Web site, subscriber to IPRA publications, purchaser of IPRA products or an IPRA member, you may review and update/correct your information by using your user name and password or by contacting the IPRA at 630-752-0141.    Updates or corrections to certain types of information will require independent verification prior to effectuating any (permanent) change to our files.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>As our organization, membership and benefits change from time to time; this Online Privacy Statement is expected to change as well.  The IPRA reserves the right to amend the Online Privacy Statement at any time, for any reason.  We will post notice that this Statement has been amended by revising the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>This Online Privacy Statement applies ONLY to information collected by the IPRA through its Web site</li>
