					   <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
						<p>It is the mission of the Illinois Park and Recreation Association to provide opportunities that enhance the professional well being of its members and to be an advocate for the lifetime benefits of parks, recreation and conservation.</p>
						
						<h4>Purpose</h4>
						<p>The Illinois Park and Recreation Association is a not-for-profit organization and public interest group whose members share the common goal of providing quality park and recreation opportunities for the citizens of Illinois.</p>
						
						<h4>Membership</h4>
						<p>IPRA's 2600 members are recreation and park professionals, vendors, citizens and students who are committed to serving the leisure needs of a continually changing society. They are advocates for the lifetime benefits of parks and recreation.</p>
						
						<h4>Citizenry Served</h4>
						<p>IPRA's members are responsible for planning and administering recreation programs and maintaining and preserving open space in park districts, city recreation and park departments, county forest preserves, conservation districts, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, special recreation associations, state mental health and correctional centers, hospitals, special sport facilities, universities and private recreation concerns.</p>
						
						<h4>Activities</h4>
						<p>The Illinois Park and Recreation Association provides opportunities that enhance the professional well being of its members. Educational activities include the Annual Conference with an exposition and specialized sessions for all levels of the park and recreation field; workshops and seminars throughout the year; state wide athletic programs; a senior olympics program; a special populations olympic program; a strong legislative program; sports/cultural events and tickets; a Foundation which promotes the park and recreation movement; and an administrative office which serves as an information and resource center.</p>
						
						<h4>Organization</h4>
						<p>IPRA relies heavily on membership involvement to advance the association's goals and public awareness projects. The organization is governed by a twenty member Board of Directors elected by the membership. The board is complemented by committees and sections which cater to members' specific work areas (see Sections). The voluntary participation of IPRA members allows the association to actively promote the profession and the benefits of parks and recreation throughout Illinois. To coordinate volunteer efforts, an administrative office is maintained in Carol Stream, a western Chicago suburb, which is staffed by eight full-time and five part-time professionals. Funding: IPRA's operating funds are derived from membership dues, conferences, workshops, various services and activities, and donations.</p>
						
						<h4>History</h4>
						<p>Organized as the Illinois Recreation Association in 1944, the original membership of 48 has increased each year, reaching 1120 in 1976 when the present name was adopted. Today, there are over 2600 IPRA members.</p>
