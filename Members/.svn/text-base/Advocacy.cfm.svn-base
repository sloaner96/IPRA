                        Governor Blagojevich Proposes Elimination of OSLAD 
                        Funding!</strong></p>
                        <p>
                        During his recent budget address, Governor Blagojevich 
                        proposed elimination of the Open Space Land Acquisition 
                        and Development program (OSLAD). In doing so he said:</p>
                        <p>
                        “In addition, we’re proposing a holiday from the Open 
                        Space Lands Acquisition program. Acquiring open lands is 
                        important. Developing them is too. But in a year when 
                        the economy is struggling - a year where you have to 
                        make tough choices, to us, we think a holiday is 
                        reasonable, and it will save us $34 million.” 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The Governor’s proposal is staggering in light of the 
                        fact that this program currently has a dedicated revenue 
                        stream and is a quality grant program which is matched 
                        at the local level in order to ensure the preservation 
                        of land into perpetuity. </p>
                        <p>
                        The OSLAD program represents an infinitesimal amount of 
                        the State of Illinois’s budget and is the only available 
                        funding source for the acquisition of open space in 
                        Illinois. It is beyond belief that the Governor would 
                        target this particular program for elimination. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In 
                        Illinois we cannot afford to take a holiday from the 
                        preservation of open space and the development of 
                        recreational areas for Illinois citizens. </p>
                        <p>At 
                        a time when obesity is at an epidemic level and the 
                        elimination of after school sports programs throughout 
                        the public school system leaves the physical fitness of 
                        children throughout Illinois in serious question, 
                        reducing Illinois’ commitment to such a program is 
                        moving diametrically in the wrong direction. </p>
                        <p>At 
                        a time when the cost of Illinois’ remaining open space 
                        skyrockets at double digit increases every year can we 
                        afford to put this modest open space preservation 
                        program on “holiday”?</p>

                        which has such a rich history in funding the protection 
                        of open space and the development of recreational 
                        opportunities for your constituents and theirs. It is
