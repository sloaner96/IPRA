                      Did you 
                      know state law requires government entities to recycle 
                      fluorescent lamps?</p>
                      <p>IPRA has partnered 
                      with Fluorecycle, Inc. to offer IPRA member agencies 
                      discounted recycling of used fluorescent lamps. 
                      Fluorecycle, Inc. would offer park and recreation agencies 
                      unit &amp; bulk pricing on their recycling of lamps that 
                      contain mercury. </p>
                      <p>
                      Fluorecycle, Inc. is the only 
                      fluorescent/HID/mercury containing lamp company permitted 
                      by the IEPA to operate as a destination facility and the 
                      only company with a RCRA part B permit in Illinois.&nbsp; That 
                      means that if a lamp is destroyed (the IEPA's word for the 
                      final status of the lamp or that the mercury has been 
                      removed) in Illinois, it has to go through Fluorecycle, 
                      Inc. Other companies can collect, handle, transport lamps 
                      in Illinois, but they have to send them to a destination 
                      facility outside of Illinois.&nbsp; That usually means more 
                      paperwork in manifesting loads and higher transportation 
                      costs. </p>
					  
                      <p>Fluorecycle can provide 
                      documentation that the lamps have been destroyed and the 
                      components recycled</p>
					  
                      <p>Carry $3 million of liability 
                      pollution insurance</p>

					  <p>99% recycled components back to industry</p>
					  
					  <p>Only IEPA permitted lamp destination facility</p>
					  
					  <p>Two methods of recycling your lamps: Bulk (large generator, most economical) or Mail Order (small generator, most convenient)</p>
