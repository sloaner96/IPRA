                      <strong>IPRA Member Printing Program</strong>
                      <p>The program is
                      called the IPRA Member Royalty Agreement for Printing and
                      Services provided by Impress Printing. There is no
                      obligation for members to use Impress and no obligation by
                      Impress to take a project outside of its capabilities.<br>
                      <br>
                      The program works as follows:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>IPRA members, in good faith, make an effort to
                          include Impress in their bidding process.
                        <li>Impress will provide consultation on project for
                          design or other cost reduction recommendations.
                          Consultation will guarantee no less than a 10%
                          (including royalty) project cost savings compared to
                          other competitive bids.
                        <li>Impress will maintain individual and confidential
                          records of all printing preformed by Impress.
                        <li>Members will be able to order online
                        <li>Online proofs will be provided
                        <li>Each member will receive a Royalty payment on an
                          annual basis based upon the total sales performed by
                          Impress for that member. The royalty payment schedule
                          is:<br>
                          <br>
                          $200k+ - 10%<br>
                          150-200k - 9%<br>
                          100-150k - 8%<br>
                          50-100k - 7%<br>
                          25-50k - 6%<br>
                          &lt; 25k - 5%<br>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
